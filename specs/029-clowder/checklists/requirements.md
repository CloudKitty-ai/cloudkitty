# Specification Quality Checklist: Clowder — viewer load benchmark

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-08-12
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validated 2026-08-12 against the initial draft. Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
  markers: the three candidate ambiguities (target shape, results storage,
  pass/fail gating) all had defensible defaults, recorded in Assumptions.
- SC-004 references `crates/` as a scope boundary, which names a directory
  rather than a technology; judged acceptable since the boundary itself is
  the requirement.
